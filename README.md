# Card Game Project 2

## User Stories

1. As a user I would like to have a random card selected at the beginning and displayed 
2. As a user I would like to be able to guess whether the next card is higher or lower
3. As a user I should get feedback whether the guess I made was correct or incorrect
4. As a user I would like to have the second random card displayed to show if incorrect or correct
5. As a user I would like to have the name of the card displayed each time instead of a number
6. As a user I would like to be able to place a bet also whilst guessing if higher or lower
7. As a user I should get feedback when I have lost all my money from betting or I have reached the goal set
