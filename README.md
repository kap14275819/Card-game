# Card Game Project 2

## Game Description
#### ThIs game is about winning a card game to win a prize at the end. This card game is a 'high' or 'low' card game which means that there is a deck of cards which then one is randomly selected and then displayed. Once the user has read this card they have to guess whether the next card will be 'higher' or 'lower'. If the guess is correct they then win a cash pize. In the game also betting has been implemented which allows them to choose a small amount of money to bet with to then reach a score of 1000 or more.

## User Stories

#### As a user I should get feedback whether the guess I made was correct or incorrect
#### As a user I would like to have the second random card displayed to show if incorrect or correct
